A long-standing project that I have worked on with a team of varying sizes since 2020. This project is a complex HRIS system with many moving parts.

Contributing database architecture changes to a legacy project, authorization and authentication design, devops infrastructure, API implementation, and many of the core logic decisions especially where they relate to high risk areas and protected information.
